# Portfolio Template

This website was initially created for myself. I created the application using tailwind and next.js.
To change the data presented on the website, it's an easy process. So, I decided to allow others to reuse the application.

## Prerequisites
1. NodeJS - [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Code Editor - I recommend Visual Studio Code - [Download Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3. Git - [Download Here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Running the application
### Installation
1. Clone the repo - ```git clone https://github.com/ChaudharySamirZafar/PortfolioTemplate```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the directory in visual studio code
3. Install dependencies - ```npm install```

### Usage
1. Launch the application - ```npm run dev```
2. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. Browse the site

### Modifying
1. Navigate to the root directory of the application
2. Navigate to /lib/data
3. Change any data file in there and hit "CTRL + S" to see the changes on the application.

### Deployment
Once you are happy with the changes you have made, it's time to deploy. I use Vercel to deploy my applications.
1. Push your code to Github by creating a repository, when you push your code via visual studio code it'll give you an option to create a new repository.
2. Follow Vercel's guide on [how to deploy a Github repository](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git#deploying-a-git-repository)

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
3. Make your changes and commit them
